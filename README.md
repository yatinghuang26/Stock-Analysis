# stock-analysis

Overview of Project: 
The purpose of this analysis is to examine the return of multiple stocks in recent years (2017 and 2018), but especially DQ to see if it is worth investing in.

Results: 
The performance of 2017 stock market was very good. All except one stock had a positive return in investment. Even the stock with negative return was not very high, at -7.2%.
However, the performance of stocks in 2018 were dismal. All except two stocks were negative return.
The run time between the original code and the refactored code was a big difference. For the refactored code for year 2017, it only took 0.1542969 seconds. For 2018, the original took 7328.377 seconds whereas the refactored code took 0.1660156 seconds.

Summary: 
The advantage of refactoring code makes it more efficient to run code for different sets of data. In this case, it ran both years. For someone that just wants one thing to complete all tasks, this is easier and more convenient. Also, since the refactored code is cleaner, it is easier to debug and deal with if needed.
The disadvantage of refactoring code is how time consuming it is. Somtimes it is not necessary to refactor the code if the original code worked well. If we just need to run one thing, creating buttons will still get the same job done.
